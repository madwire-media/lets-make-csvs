Alright, so your script is up on MDFC42XLargeC7Fatty under `~/big-cleaning-lady/src/madwire-product-audit`
To run it, ssh into MDFC42XLargeC7Fatty, run `docker exec -ti big-cleaning-lady bash`, `cd /root/app/src/madwire-product-audit`, and then whatever you do from there
I setup a shell script on my machine for a similar project

I can commit to my repo and pull from here?

Running a `captain_update.sh` or clicking the update button in captain for `big-cleaning-lady` will update your source code because I made it a git submodule
So you can still commit to your original repository too

ok i'll make a notes doc so I can remember all of this
